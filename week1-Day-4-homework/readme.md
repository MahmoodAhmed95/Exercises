# Trulia Property Listing

The goal of this homework is to build a responsive product list page for Trulia. 


* The "Design Mock.jpeg" shows an example of what the page should look like.
* In the starter code there is the text content and additional notes on the colors and fonts to use.
* The navigation is pre-built and can be used to study responsive code approaches
* Responsive notes for the product grid:
    ** At screens wider than 1600px the properties should be 6-across
    ** At 1200-1600px it should be 4-across
    ** At mobile sizes it should be 2-across
