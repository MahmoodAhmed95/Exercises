## Lab

Create a `BankAccount` class with the following members:

- **`owner`**: (attribute) The owner's name as a string
- **`balance`**: (attribute) The amount of money in the account
- **`account_no`**: (attribute) A number to be randomly generated and assigned within `__init__` - not passed in at time of instantiation
- **`deposit(amount)`**: (method) When called on an instance, increases the `balance` by the `amount` argument and returns the new balance
- **`withdraw(amount)`**: (method) When called on an instance, decreases the `balance` by the `amount` argument and returns the new balance

Here's how to generate a random integer for the in Python:

```python
# Put this line at the top of the repl
import random

# Use this inside of BankAccount's __init__ to generate
# a random account number from 111111111 to 999999999
self.account_no = random.randint(111111111, 999999999)
```

Create two instances, make both deposits and withdrawals, and print the attributes to test them out.

#### Bonus 1

Override the `__str__` method to return the following formatted string:

```
Account <account_no> / Balance: xxxxx.xx
```

#### Bonus 2

Create a `SavingsAccount` class that subclasses `BankAccount` and specializes it so that the `withdraw` method no longer accepts any argument, does not change the balance, and returns a string of `No withdrawals permitted`.

#### Bonus 3

Add an additional `has_overdraft` attribute to the `BankAccount` class that accepts `True` or `False` at the time of instantiation, but defaults to `False` if not passed in (hint: review default parameters discussed above).

When the `withdraw` method is called, do not allow the withdraw if the amount being withdrawn is greater than `balance`, unless `has_overdraft` is `True`.  `withdraw` should continue to return the `balance`.
